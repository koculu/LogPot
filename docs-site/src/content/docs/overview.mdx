LogPot is a modern, TypeScript-first logging library for Node.js that makes it easy to emit structured, high-performance logs anywhere you need them. console, files, HTTP endpoints, or your own custom sink. It provides:

- **Structured, Typed Logs**
  Every log entry is a plain object with well-defined properties (`msg`, `level`, `time`, `meta`), making downstream processing, aggregation and querying a breeze.

- **Pluggable Transports**
  Choose from built-in transports (console, file with rotation, HTTP) or write your own by subclassing the abstract `Transport`. Offload heavy I/O to worker threads for minimal impact on your main event loop.

- **Rich Formatting & Themes**
  Serialize logs as JSON arrays, NDJSON, envelopes, or fully-customizable templates with padding, truncation, color/styling (including hex/RGB colors and emojis). Easy to adapt for human-readable console output or machine-ingestion.

- **Error Serialization**
  Turn thrown `Error` objects (including nested causes and `AggregateError`) into safe, circular-free descriptors with optional stack, cause and aggregation support.

- **Fine-Grained Control**

  - **Filtering & Transformation**: Drop or mutate logs before they’re emitted.
  - **Level Definitions**: Default levels (TRACE→FATAL) or define your own name⇄number mappings.
  - **Global & Per-Transport Settings**: Control minimum levels, categories, batching, retries, back-pressure, gzip compression, and more.

LogPot aims to give you both a **developer-friendly** API (TypeScript types, child loggers, scoped metadata) and **production-ready** robustness (async job queues, automatic file rotation, retry logic, worker isolation). Perfect for services, CLIs, or any Node.js app that demands reliability and clarity in its logs.

## Core Concepts

### Logger

A fully-typed, level-aware interface with convenience methods (`.info()`, `.error()`, etc.), plus `.child()` and `.withMeta()` for structured contexts.

### Transports

Abstract sinks that receive `Log` objects. Choose from built-in Console, File, HTTP, or implement your own by extending the `Transport` base.

### Formatter

Controls the wire format of your logs. Swap between JSON arrays, NDJSON, envelopes or free-form templates. Configure field mapping, gzip compression, and custom placeholder hooks.

### Error Serialization

Automatically convert `Error`, `AggregateError`, and nested `cause` chains into safe, circular-free error stacks and custom hooks included.

## Quick Example

```ts
import { createLogger } from 'logpot'

const logger = await createLogger({
  levels: { TRACE: 10, DEBUG: 20, INFO: 30, WARN: 40, ERROR: 50 },
  runAsWorker: true,
  consoleTransport: {
    formatter: {
      kind: 'template',
      template: '{time} {level:lower padend 6} {msg}\n{meta}',
    }
   },
  fileTransport: {
    filename: 'app.log',
    rotate: { interval: 'daily', maxFiles: 7, maxSize: 1_024_000, compress: true },
    batchSize: 100,
    flushInterval: 2000,
  },
  httpTransport: {
    url: 'https://ingest.acme.com/logs',
    auth: {
      type: 'oauth2',
      tokenUrl: 'https://auth.acme.com/token',
      clientId,
      clientSecret,
    },
    batchSize: 50,
    flushInterval: 5000,
  },
})

logger.info('Server started', { port: 8080 })
logger.error(new Error('Database failure'))
```
